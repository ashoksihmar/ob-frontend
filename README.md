## Overview
**ob-frontend** is a modern implementation of the WordPress frontend as a [single-page application (SPA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/choose-between-traditional-web-and-single-page-apps#when-to-choose-spas).  This template, developed and packaged as a [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/starters/), is a [solution](https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/definition/solution) for developers looking for the ease-of-use and flexibility that comes with using WordPress as a [CMS](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wordpress), paired with the familiar development experience and modern UI features of a [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) implementation.  The **ob-frontend** Gatsby Starter attempts to closely mirror many of the core features and functionality of the familiar WordPress UI, such as nested comments, post sidebar layout, and a mailing list widget.

## Quick Start
#### 1.  Deploy a WordPress backend
This starter theme relies on a WordPress backend from which to fetch data related to WordPress posts, pages, comments, etc.  You can deploy the WordPress backend using the hosting provider of your choice. In the above demo, the WordPress backend is deployed on a GCP Compute Engine f1-micro VM Instance.  

#### 2.  Configure a domain name
Configure a domain name for your WordPress backend (with HTTPS).  In this example, the WordPress backend is served from a subdomain (cms.example.com), and the WordPress frontend (ie. ob-frontend) is served from the root domain (example.com).  Serving the WordPress backend from a subdomain is optional, however, you will need to change the **SOURCE_URL** environment variable to match the URL of your WordPress backend.

#### 3.  Create a Gatsby site
Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the ob-frontend starter.

```sh
# Create a new Gatsby site using the ob-frontend starter
gatsby new blog https://github.com/onepagezen/ob-frontend
```

#### 4.  Create environment variable files
This theme relies heavily on enivronment variables in order to get up and running quickly.  After creating the site using the Gatsby CLI (step 3), run the following commands to configure the environment variables for your site:
```sh
# Navigate into your new site's directory  
cd ob-frontend  
  
# Create .env files for both the development and production environments
touch .env.development .env.production
```

#### 5.  Add development environment variables
Add the following environment variables to your **.env.development** file, making sure to replace **example.com** with your own domain name, and **MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT** with the [form action URL](https://secomapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031503791-How-to-find-the-MailChimp-Form-Action-URL-) of your MailChimp mailing list:
```sh
SITE_URL=https://localhost:8000
BASE_URL=cms.example.com
BASE_URL_PROTOCOL=https
SOURCE_URL=https://cms.example.com
REPLACEMENT_URL=localhost:8000
GATSBY_CLIENT_URL=https://cms.example.com/graphql
MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://example.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0893ac8473c98fa98eeef3fd5&amp;id=f4cbbd81d6
```

#### 6.  Add production environment variables
Add the following environment variables to your **.env.production** file, making sure to replace **example.com** with your own domain name, and **MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT** with the endpoint of your Mailchimp mailing list:
```sh
SITE_URL=https://example.com
BASE_URL=cms.example.com
BASE_URL_PROTOCOL=https
SOURCE_URL=https://cms.example.com
REPLACEMENT_URL=example.com
GATSBY_CLIENT_URL=https://cms.example.com/graphql
MAILCHIMP_ENDPOINT=https://example.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=0893ac8473c98fa98eeef3fd5&amp;id=f4cbbd81d6
```

## Deploy with Netlify
#### 1.  Deploy the site
Use the **Deploy with Netlify** button to quickly deploy a website based on this starter.  
<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/onepagezen/ob-frontend" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>  

#### 2.  Configure environment variables
When deploying with Netlify, make sure to add the production environment variables to your Netlify build environment.  One option is to add them in your site dashboard under **Settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables**.
