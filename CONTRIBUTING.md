# Contributing to ob-frontend
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing a new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/onepagezen/ob-frontend/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/onepagezen/ob-frontend/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Below are two bug report templates that you can use for reference:
* [StackOverflow example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)  
* [OpenRadar example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce with sample code
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
* We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
* Always use cwd-relative paths rather than root-relative paths in image URLs in any CSS. So instead of url('/images/blah.gif'), use url('../images/blah.gif').
